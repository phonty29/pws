It's a simple chat with WebSockets for real-time conversation. All server-side is written on Express framework and the database that I choose is Mongo, 'cause it's simple and doesn't require knowledge on SQL. The chat is multi-page, so all the renderings happen on server. For this purpose I used EJS.
