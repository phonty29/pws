One of the hardest thing I've made so far. It's not perfect at all, but I learned so much technologies then and grow my knowledge on Web and Internet.

It's a simple chat with WebSockets for real-time conversation. But every developer knows that making chat is not easy. I'm really proud that it really works and
even now you can use it for some small-talk with your friends. All server-side is written on Express framework and the database that I choose is Mongo, 'cause it's simple 
and doesn't require knowledge on SQL. The chat is multi-page, so all the renderings happen on server. For this purpose I used EJS.
